## How it works

Does it even work?

## How to test

TODO: Document this. I know, I'm awful, but I'm literally doing this in the last 14 hours of the submission deadline.

## External hardware

This project requires an external SPI SRAM, and also an external VGA breakout board! I'm going to make them, and give them out for free.
